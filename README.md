# GPU Programming Practical

This repo contains assignments from the GPU programming practical at the Technical University of Munich.

The underlying graphics API is *Vulkan*, but this practical added an abstraction layer with the [TGA](https://github.com/Estard/TGA) library 

The outline of the practical and the goal for each assignment was:
1. Code setup, first "Hello Triangle" program
2. Buffers, Textures, Samplers, Forward Rendering
3. Textures as render targets, Deferred Rendering, Post Processing
4. Geometry Batching, Multi Draw Indirect
5. Compute Shaders, GPGPU, Compute Based Culling
6. Simple Ray Tracing
7. Custom Data Structures, Ray Tracing Acceleration

The was a group final project which I contributed to: [hybrid](https://github.com/alpcihan/hybrid)
